# CBTI-Agent
An AI Agent based on psychological theories for clients with insonmia.

Countless individuals suffering from insomnia are grappling with multiple psychological challenges such as depression, anxiety, social barriers, and sleep issues. However, professional psychological support resources often face practical difficulties including low awareness, scarcity, geographical constraints, and delayed responses.

In this context, the AI Agent we have developed serves as an around-the-clock, zero-distance mental support system equipped with expertise in cognitive behavioral therapy. It can instantly respond to user needs, provide continuous emotional companionship and cognitive intervention, and efficiently empower users in self-regulation and personal growth.

The system aims to significantly amplify the service efficiency of limited mental health resources, enhancing their value tenfold or even a hundredfold. It particularly establishes a safe, reliable, and accessible digital bridge for student populations in urgent need of psychological support.

The entire project is based on the following psychological theories:
- Cognitive Behavior Therapy
- Case Conceptualization
